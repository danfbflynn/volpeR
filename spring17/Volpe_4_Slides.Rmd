## Overview 

### Last session:

- Comparing means of groups of variables 
    + T-test and ANOVA
    + Loops
    + P-values


### Today: Communicating results 

- Basic graphics
- `ggplot2` package
- `Rmarkdown` introduction

## Homework

*We will review your work on these two at the end of the session, time permitting*

### Loops

1. R skill: write two loops. One should loop generate random subsets of your data; Another should loop over rows in a data frame and perform some operation

### Outliers

2. Stats skill: test your data for outliers, using your models from Homework 2. 
Hubway `tripduration` outlier test: 
Read in the Hubway data from the course page and look at tripduration. How would you decide which data should be considered outliers?


## Basic graphics

You have already seen the power of `plot()` in examples. We have used it to make scatterplots, but also to make diagnostic plots of linear models. When in doubt, you can always try to `plot()` an object and R will make a guess about what kind of plot you want.

Example:
```{r}
data(iris) # see ?iris

# Formula (y ~ x) versus (x, y) specification
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris)
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Length) # identical
# plot(Petal.Length, Sepal.Length, data = iris) # fails
```
## Basic graphics
The power of the base graphics package in R is control of each element of the plot. The challenge is knowing how to exercise that control!
`par()` sets graphics parameters and contains much of what you want to do. Highlights from `par`:


    mfrow - matrix format. Set to c(1, 2) for two panel figure, adjacent 
    pch   - plotting character. 
    lty   - line type. Try lty = 2 or lty = 3
    cex   - character expansion. Very useful for making symbols more visible
    mar   - margins. Set to mar = rep(1, 4) for narrow margins all around.
    col   - colors, see colors() for full list or
    www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)

## Basic graphics

```{r, fig.height = 4.25}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), 
    pch = 16,
    cex = 1.5) # makes everything bigger

plot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, 
     col = "grey80",
          data = iris)

plot(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width, 
     col = "dodgerblue",
     pch = 15, # can override par settings
          data = iris)
```


## Basic graphics
`barplot()` can be used to create a bar chart, but it is a bit clunky to add error bars. Basic workflow:

```{r, fig.height = 4.25}
means <- tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
sds <-  tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, sd)

bp <- barplot(means)  # save the location of the bars as 'bp'

arrows(bp, means+sds, # see ?arrows
       bp, means-sds, 
       angle = 90,
       code = 3)
```




## Basic graphics
Improve a graphic by ensuring that there are clear labels (`arrows` code not shown).
<!-- two versions, one with arrows code not shown for conciseness -->
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
par(mar = c(3, 4, 3, 1)) # Narrowing margins
bp <- barplot(means, 
              ylab = "Mean sepal length (cm, ? 1 s.d.)",
              main = "Iris species sepal lengths",
              xaxt = "n", # suppress axis plotting here
              ylim = c(0, 7.5))

axis(side = 1, at = bp, 
     labels = paste("Iris", c("setosa", "versicolor","virginica")),
     font = 3)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mar = c(3, 4, 3, 1)) # Narrowing margins
bp <- barplot(means, 
              ylab = "Mean sepal length (cm, ? 1 s.d.)",
              main = "Iris species sepal lengths",
              xaxt = "n",
              ylim = c(0, 7.5))
arrows(bp, means+sds, bp, means-sds, 
       len = 0.1, 
       angle = 90,
       code = 3)
axis(side = 1, at = bp, 
     labels = paste("Iris", c("setosa", "versicolor","virginica")),
     font = 3)
```

## Basic graphics

Save your graphics typically as pdf or jpeg. You can do this by putting `pdf()` and `dev.off()` around your code, or by using `dev.print()`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
pdf("Test graphic.pdf", width = 4, height = 6)
plot(1:10, pch = 1:10, col = 1:10, cex = 2)
dev.off()

plot(1:10, pch = 11:20, col = rainbow(10), cex = 2)
dev.print(device = jpeg, file = "Test graphic.jpg", height = 500, width = 800)

```

## ggplot graphics

A different model of graphics has recently become popular. `ggplots` use a different 'grammar' of graphics, and can be great for quickly making visually-appealing graphics. Mastering the control of each element can take time.

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # install.packages('ggplot2')
#       Dataset               x               y         type of plot
gp1 <- ggplot(iris) + aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length) + geom_point()

gp1 

```

## ggplot graphics

You can use one basic graph data set and do different versions of it. Two ways of visualizing a factor grouping:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gp1 + geom_point(aes(color = Species))
gp1 + facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4.5}
ex1 <- gp1 + geom_point(aes(color = Species))
ex2 <- gp1 + facet_wrap(~ Species)
grid.arrange(ex1, ex2, ncol =2)
```

## Tables in R

Carrying out any analysis in R generates a lot of tables. A few options:

- Copy and paste
- Sink
- Save to text file

Simplest is copy and paste from the console window into Excel, then use text-to-columns. But not repeatable!

## Tables in R

You can 'sink' your output to a text file. First, set up all your analysis, then put `sink()` before and after your block of code.

```{r, eval = F}
sink("Test Sink.txt")
with(iris, cor.test(Sepal.Width, Petal.Width))
table(iris$Species)
sink()
```

Or output a data frame to a text file directly:
```{r}
write.csv(iris[1:10,], file = "Iris Test.csv", row.names = F)
```

## R Markdown

A better way for writing a report is to take advantage of the relatively recent tool, R Markdown. A few resources:

http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html

Go to File > New File ... > R Markdown

Select HTML or Word as the default output, and then try clicking 'knit'.

You may need to `install.packages("rmarkdown")`


<!-- ![You should get this!](images/snip4.png) --> 

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/snip4.png")
```

## R Markdown
There are three parts to the `.Rmd` markdown file:

### Header

```{r, out.width = "90px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Header.jpg")
```

### Markdown text

```{r, out.height = "200px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Text.jpg")
```

### R code

```{r, out.width = "50px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rcode.jpg")
```

## Tables in Markdown

The simplest way to integrate tables in Markdown is to format your data frame using the `kable` function. Other options include `pander()` in the `pander` library. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TableKable.jpg")

```

## Excercise: Generate report

### Start a Markdown report

In the remaining time, start a report using R Markdown:

- Start a new Markdown file
- Source or copy in your project analysis
- Present key findings graphically
    + Try to use both base graphics and `ggplot` 
- Add explanatory text.
    + Use font embellishments as necessary

## More reporting options
These three additional options are all sophisticated tools, requiring substantial up-front time investment. 

### Sweave / LaTeX 

The gold standard for publishing repeatable research is LaTeX (often written as \LaTeX). Rmarkdown is based off of LaTeX in many ways. R code can be 'woven' in to LaTeX using `Sweave` syntax, which  Rmarkdown emulates in a simplified way.

## Homework review: Loops
Loop to generate random subsets of your data:

```{r}
# Get 10 samples of data from each species:
sampx <- vector()
for(i in levels(iris$Species)){
  iris.sp.i <- iris[iris$Species == i,]
  sampx <- rbind(sampx, iris.sp.i[sample(rownames(iris.sp.i), 10),])
  }
```

Loop over rows in a data frame and perform some operation:
```{r}
# Subtract mean from each 
means <- apply(iris[,1:4], 2, mean)
newdat <- vector()
for(i in 1:nrow(iris)){
  newdat.x <- iris[i,1:4] - means
  newdat <- rbind(newdat, data.frame(newdat.x, iris[i,5]))
  }
# Examine it: hist(newdat[,2]); hist(iris[,2])
```



## Homework review: Outliers

Stats skill: test your data for outliers, using your models from Homework 2. 

We will review `tripduration` outliers from the Hubway data.
